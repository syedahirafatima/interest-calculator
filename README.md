# Features:
1. Calculates **Simple Interest**  
2. Calculates **Compound Interest**  
3. Clean, interactive user input  
4. Uses basic math and logic  
5. Beginner-friendly structure

# Formulas Used:
- **Simple Interest (SI)**  
  \[
  \text{SI} = \frac{P \times R \times T}{100}
  \]
- **Compound Interest (CI)**  
  \[
  \text{CI} = P \times \left(1 + \frac{R}{100} \right)^T - P
  \]
Where:
`P` = Principal amount  
`R` = Annual interest rate (%)
`T` = Time in years  

# How It Works:
1. User selects interest type: Simple or Compound.
2. Inputs the `principal`, `rate`, and `time`.
3. Program calculates the interest based on the selected method.
4. Result is displayed in the terminal.

# Demo:
Welcome to the Interest Calculator!
1. Simple Interest
2. Compound Interest
Choose interest type (1 or 2): 1
Enter principal amount: 1000
Enter annual interest rate (%): 5
Enter time period (in years): 2
Simple Interest is: 100.0

# What I Learnt:
1. Getting user input with input()
2. Converting strings to numbers using float()
3. Creating and calling functions 
4. Using conditionals (if, elif, else)
5. Performing math operations in Python
