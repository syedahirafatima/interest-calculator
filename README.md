# 💰 Interest Calculator

A simple Python program to calculate **Simple Interest** and **Compound Interest** based on user input.  
This project demonstrates basic Python concepts like functions, user input, and conditional statements.

---

## 🧮 Features

- Calculate **Simple Interest**
- Calculate **Compound Interest**
- Interactive command-line interface

---

## 🧠 Formula Used
### Simple Interest (SI)
$$
\text Simple{ }Interest = \frac{P \times R \times T}{100}
$$

### Compound Interest (CI)

$$
A = P \times \left(1 + \frac{R}{100}\right)^T
$$

$$
\text  Compound{ }Interest = A - P
$$

Where:  
- `P` = Principal amount  
- `R` = Annual interest rate (in %)  
- `T` = Time period (in years)  
- `A` = Final amount after the interest compounds
